## 💫 Design Language

> *"Less interface, more atmosphere."*  
>  
> Inspired by Apple’s design language and aurora-like motion,  
> Auralux focuses on emotion through simplicity — fluid animation,  
> layered transparency, and subtle gradients of light.

## 🪩 Recording & Export

| Action | Effect |
|--------|---------|
| `● Record` | Starts a real-time screen + audio capture |
| `■ Stop` | Saves your visualization as `.webm` |
| `Export Track` | Renders entire track from start to finish |

---

## 🌐 Compatibility

- Chrome, Edge, Safari — full feature support  
- Firefox — works without recording (limited MediaRecorder)  
- Mobile browsers — responsive layout, touch-optimized  

---

## 💻 Requirements

No dependencies.  
Just open `index.html` — it runs natively in your browser.  

> For microphone use, start a local server:
> ```bash
> python3 -m http.server
> ```
